# dPay Desktop Wallet

dPay Wallet is a lite wallet for the dPay blockchain that you can run on your desktop computer without needing to run the blockchain itself.

**This is experimental and messy software at the moment, please use with caution.**

## Questions or ideas?

We have a [dForum](https://dforum.io) (decentralized forum powered by the dPay blockchain) running here:

[https://chainbb.com/f/dpay](https://dforum.io/f/dpay)

This forum will serve as the primary point of discussion for the dPay desktop wallet aka dWallet.
